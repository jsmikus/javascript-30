###### What I've learned:
1. **On HTML & CSS**: Using data attributes can be very useful. Please check [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) for more.
2. **On JS**: Resetting the sound with *currentTime*.
3. **On life**: Surely the real drums are more fun.

- [x] 02. [JS and CSS Clock](https://github.com/jsmikus/javascript-30/tree/master/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock)
![Preview](https://github.com/jsmikus/javascript-30/blob/master/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock/preview02.jpg)
###### What I've learned:
1. **On HTML&CSS**: Exaggerated visual effects have gone out of fashion long ago. With an overwhelming amount of information and difficulties with attention, readability and minimalism is what counts.
2. **On JS**: There is always a way to write something in a smaller amount of code. It depends on your state of knowledge. Before you start shortening excessively, ask yourself: will this code be readable and reusable? When working together on a project, someone will often work with your code.
3. **On life**: Clock's hands are definitely not the biggest fans of the digitization era.

###### What I've learned:
1. **On HTML&CSS**: So far, I've used variables in Sass but it seems a nice way to have clean code in smaller projects.
2. **On JS**: I really like and getting used to using *ternary operator*. It significantly reduce the lines of code.
3. **On life**: When I was building this simple editor, my sister asked me: "Would't it be better to have automatic filters like on Instagram?". Now, I already know how to build such a uncomplicated thing.

###### What I've learned:
1. **On HTML&CSS**: n/a
2. **On JS**: The coolest project so far. Finding solutions gave me a lot of pleasure and satisfaction. A good introduction to functional programming about which I later read many articles.
3. **On life**: For some time now when using many devices, machines and apps, I wonder how specific functionalities have been built and how I would solve a given problem or assumed action.

###### What I've learned:
1. **On HTML&CSS**: I really flex-based projects and working with is really nice. It was similar in this case. I do also know that I have to work out the CSS Grid more.
2. **On JS**: I've never used the *transitioned* event before so it is a kind of lesson. Also figuring out how to deal with multiple events of above type by  function looking for an event was a valuable information.
3. **On life**: The flexibility is very important. In attitude, coding and physical form.

###### What I've learned:
1. **On HTML&CSS**: I enjoy working with more flat design than in example so I made little changes. I also chose other JSON file to work with countries.
2. **On JS**: The challenge in my project was some of countries with no population data. I need to change the *null* value to the string named unknown. Otherwise countries with this value were not displayed on the list due to the inability to use *toString()* on *null* value. 
3. **On life**: The number of people in the world is amazing.
